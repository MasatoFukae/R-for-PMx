## Introduction of R for Pharmacometrics

Welcome to **R for pharmacometrics**!  
Tutors try to provide accurate code. However, incorrect one may be included. Please use it at your own risk.  
This document was built by `r R.Version()$version.string`.  

日本語も利用可能です。あまりおすすめしませんが、利用するならエンコーディングに注意してください。

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Basic of R

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6)
x
print(x)
x[2]
x[2] <- 20
x

sum(c(2, 4, 6))
x <- c(2, 4, 6)
sum(x)
sumOfX <- sum(x)
sumOfX

```

## Tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
x %>% sum(x)
sumOfX <- x %>% sum()
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
